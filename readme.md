# Unix Playground

A series of x86_64 unix binary crackmes made by me.

Made to help understand the basic primatives of binary
exploitatoin as well as a reminder for different techniques.

Ideally challenges increase in difficulty but should
be paired with a test directory that solves the challenge.
